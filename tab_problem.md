##  Problem Definition

  

You are now ready to roll out Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools in your enterprise! You secured the budget, bought the tool(s) and started onboard applications and/or code repos to be scanned by the tool X. For the first 5 apps, everything goes well but you quickly realize:

 1. This is an immense tasks - how do I scale for the next
    20/30/100/200 apps
    
   
 2. We are losing too much time to customize & onboard the
    applications - each app has a “long time to market”. Which
    directories contain the test cases again ?
    
    
 3. Who owns this file/code/url ? You might have uncovered deeper fundamental problems in your organization code management approach as it relates to file/code ownership. Particularly when the bazaar approach is followed with no central control on code repository or source creation and maintenance.
    
 4. How do I test specific features ? Are there any ares of the application that should be off limits ?
 
 6.  Which users can I use to login in the test environment ?

SAST and DAST are a great way to find security defects in code or applications at scale. Experience tells us that getting the most value from these important programs can be tricky. We need a new approach to extract the most value for our investment.
